# e-commerce-retail
The project consists of developing a B2B e-commerce platform that enables wholesale e-commerce between corporate customers. It offers B2B and B2C multi-channel commerce experiences on a single platform.
With B2B Checkout, business customers can easily access company-specific information, such as payment terms, preferred payment method, and wholesale discounts, every time they place an order.
B2B Checkout allows:
 To create Multi-Store.
 The logistics of its products (inventory management, deliveries, delivery tracking)
 Marketing (up-selling, cross-selling, abandoned cart recovery)
 Online payment
 Order management
 Returns management
 Abandoned cart recovery
 Optimize the process and customer experience
